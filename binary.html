EXPLANATION: 
What is the binary system? The binary system is a system that operates from the principle of 2^X, where. This means it is multiplied by two every time you achieve a higher number as shown in Binary_BONAZA. So 3 is 11 and 5 is 101. 
These 'bit' (plural Bites) are the ones and zeroes that together will formulate all possible numbers until infinity. 

The main use case of binary is for story data. Letters have a specif ANCII code, as shown on the image below. With these codes you can store data more effeciently!

It also can be used in command structures for hardware, signifying 'on' with a 1 and 'laid to rest' with a 0. 
This avoids short circuiting and overheating. 
So in short, binary is space effecient, fast and reliable and thus the preffered method of data storage and control.
