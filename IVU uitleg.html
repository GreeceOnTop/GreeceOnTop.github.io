Importing in programming refers to bringing code, libraries, or data from external sources into a program. For example, many programming languages use the import keyword to bring in external modules or functions — like import math in Python to access mathematical functions. Similarly, programs often import data files (like .csv or .json) to work with user information, configurations, or large datasets.

Exporting means saving or sending data or code out of a program so it can be used elsewhere. For example, a program might export data to a file, like saving a report to .pdf or .csv, or it might export functions or classes from a module to be used in other parts of a project. Exporting ensures that data or code is accessible and reusable outside the current context.

Processing refers to the manipulation or transformation of data within a program. This could include filtering a dataset, converting file formats, running calculations, or generating visual outputs. Processing is the core of what most software does — taking in input (import), working with it (processing), and producing output (export).

In summary, importing brings code or data into a program, exporting sends it out for use elsewhere, and processing is everything that happens in between. These three steps form a common workflow in many software applications and data-driven programs.
