I will now present through reasons why Greece is better than Turkey, if you do not have time to waste, I suggest you get on with grading other websites.
<li> <a href="reason1.html"> Reason One </a></li>
<li> <a href="reason2.html"> Reason Two </a></li>
<li> <a href="reason3.html"> Reason Three </a></li>

<h1> 
    So after these three incredibly convincing reasons, am I certain you now too realise that Greece will always prevail over Turkey. 
    If you want to be a good researcher and want the Turkish perspective, go check out TurkeyOnTop by clicking the #SupportEge link on the home page. Wihtout further ado, Good luck marking all these sites!
